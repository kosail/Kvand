ACPI is not as fast as I thought. It takes around 1 second to make the change on the hardware are retrieve the result to the call interface, while this program takes literally milliseconds. Due to this, is not possible to perform a read call right away after a value has been written. Instead, have the front end to manually call a read operation from the backend after it has requested a write operation.
